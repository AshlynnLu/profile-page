The project is motivated by a capture-recapture dataset from the largest
colony of common guillemot in the Baltic Sea, Stora Karlsö. Data were
recorded from 2009 to 2021.

Seabirds inhabit marine ecosystems and they share several life history
traits: high adult survival, a progressive access to reproduction at
relatively old ages, a low reproductive rate and a low number of natural
predators. Adult survival as well as juvenile survival, are considered
important traits that influence population dynamics in seabird species.
However, survival estimation can be challenging.

Ideally, individuals would be followed from birth to death with a given
study period, but this is rarely possible for wild populations. The
problem arises since the observation process relating to individuals is
imperfect, and hence we cannot always make a direct measurement of the
state variable of interest (i.e. alive or dead). In the wild, if an
individual is not observed two options are possible: (i) it is dead, or
(ii) it is still alive (but it has not been observed). This problem can
be addressed using the capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method.

CMR methods use data collection protocols where observers go into the
field at a series of capture events, denoted $t = 1, . . . , T$. At each
capture event, the observer marks the new individuals, records all
observed individuals (already marked) and releases them back into the
population. This leads to data corresponding to the capture history of
each individual, detailing at which capture occasions they are observed
or not.

A capture history or capture-recapture takes the form of a vector of
length the number of encounter occasions $T$, and records the value 1
for a live encounter and 0 when an individual was not encountered. For
example, an record of length $T=4$ with entries (1, 1, 0, 1) means the individual was observed at $t = 1, 2, 4$, while was not
observed at $t = 3$. This data set also contains the sex of each
individual as an additional information. The main interest in this
project is to estimate the main parameters, which are the recapture and
the apparent survival probabilities. The survival probabilities, denoted
by $\phi_t$, represent the probability of that an individual is alive at
time $t$ and survives until time $t+1$ (for time $t = 1, ..., T-1$, for
all individuals). Similarly, the recapture probabilities, denoted by
$p_t$ represent the probability of observing an individual at time $t$
(from $t = 2, ..., T$ and for all individuals).

We use $p_t$ to denote the recapture probability at occasion $t$, ang
$\phi_t$ to denote the apparent survival probability between occasion
$t$ and $t+1$.

The primary interest in these studies is usually the estimation of
survival probabilities and the associated factors (or covariates) that
may influence these. Such covariates may include for example, age,
environmental covariates, sex, individual heterogeneity, etc. In this
project we will focus on the estimation of age and/or sex-dependent
survival probabilities for this colony of common guillemots. This will
involve developing statistical models to incorporate and assess the
impact of age and sex on the survival estimates within a formal
modelling framework in order to improve our understanding of the
population which in turn may aid in their management and conservation.

```{r package, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r code=readLines("src/helper-functions/functions.R"), eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Load function definitions
source("src/helper-functions/functions.R")
```

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
load(file = "data/raw/CR.sex.chicks09.RData")
```

In the next table, and for simplicity, we present a subset of the data,

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(CR.sex.chicks09))
```

Each row contains a capture history across 13 occasions for each
individuals with the last column indicate their sex. The database
contains information about 117 individuals, all of them ringed as chicks
i.e. at age 1, therefore $T = 13$.

In this study we will use the standard Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model
which is considered a general framework for several number of extensions
and which is conditional at initial capture (ringing time). More
information about these and related models see: Serber and Schofield,
2019; McCrea and Morgan, 2015; king et al. 2010 (among many others).

We are going to implement CJS models in the frequentist approach,
building likelihood function for each model, then use `optim` function
to find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for $\boldsymbol{p}$ and
$\boldsymbol{\phi}$ parameters.

## 1. Constant Model

We start with the most basic model: model with constant $\boldsymbol{p}$
and $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ parameters. In other words, recapture and
survival probabilities are invariant with age, time and sex.

Firstly, we need to transform the capture history into m-array format.
M-array is a $(T-1) \times T$ matrix with each row representing a
released occasion ($i = 1, ..., T-1$), and each column representing a
recapture occasion ($j = 2, ..., T$). The last column contains the
number of individuals that have never been recaptured in each released
occasion. For example, the $[1, 2]$ cell contains the number of
individuals which released in occasion 1 and next recaptured in occasion
2.

We have defined a function `marray` in `functions.R` file to help us to
transform the data. Let `marr.full` be the m-array of the full data set,
which is shown below.

```{r marr-full-data, echo = FALSE}
CH <- as.matrix(CR.sex.chicks09[, -14])
n.ind <- dim(CR.sex.chicks09)[1]
n.occasion <- dim(CR.sex.chicks09[1:13])[2]
marr.full <- marray(CH)

marr.full.df <- data.frame(marr.full)
colnames(marr.full.df) <- c(paste("j =", c(2:13)), "never recaptured")
rownames(marr.full.df) <- paste("i =", c(1:12))
knitr::kable(marr.full.df)
```

Next we are going to form a likelihood function for the constant model.

Let $\underline{x}$ be the capture history of the whole data where $x_i$
is the capture history of individual $i = 1, ..., 117$, and
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ be the parameters used to estimate $p$ and $\phi$.
Since we are going to use `optim` to maximise the negative log
likelihood function to give the MLE of the desired parameters, we need
to remove the boundary of the parameters. Let $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ be
an array contains the logit transformation of the parameters $\phi$ and
$p$, then the boundary of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is now all real numbers
instead of $(0, 1)$.

Each row of the m-array follows a multinomial distribution with
parameters $N_i$ and $\underline{q}$, then the likelihood function of
the whole data is the product of multinomial distribution, i.e.

$$
L(\underline{x};\theta) = \prod_{i}^{T-1}Multinomial(N_i, \underline{q})
$$ where $N_i$ represents the total number of released animals at time
$i$ and $\underline{q} = f(\phi, p)$ is a matrix which represents the
cell probabilities depending on $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and
$\boldsymbol{p}$.

Now we are going to explain how to construct $\underline{q}$.

Firstly we need to explain how to compute the probability of a capture
history. For example, if we have a capture history

$$
x_i = 1 \quad 1 \quad 0 \quad 1 \quad 1
$$

the probability of this capture history is

$$
\mathbb{P}(x_i) = \phi p \phi (1-p) \phi p \phi p
$$

So each cell in matrix $\underline{q}$ represent the probability of an
individual being in the corresponding cell in the m-array. As the row
sum of the probabilities is 1, the last column which represent the
probability of never recaptured is 1 - row sum. For example, when
$T = 5$, matrix $\underline{q}$ has the form shown below.

![q matrix](images/q-marray.png)

We need the log likelihood function for simple calculation. The log
likelihood function is constructed by

$$
l(\underline{x}, \theta) = \sum_{i}^{T-1} \log{Multinomial(N_i, \underline{q})} = \sum_{ i= 1}^{T-1} \sum_{j = 2}^{T}\text{m-array}[i, j] \times \log{\underline{q}[i, j]}.
$$

We create a function `caplik.constant` for the negative log likelihood
function, then use `optim` to find the MLE of our parameters of
interest, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. Transfer the estimate of
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ back to $p$ and $\phi$ using `plogis`. Also, we
can obtain standard error for each parameter from inverting the Hessian
matrix at the MLE.

We can compute the credible interval for each parameter using bootstrap
method. Take 50 resamples, find lower and upper quantile for the
estimated parameters. The MLE, SD, and 95% credible interval (CI) for
estimated parameters are shown below.

```{r constant-likelihood, echo = FALSE}
caplik.constant <- function(theta, data){
  
  # Number of release occasions and recovery occasions
  
  ni = dim(data)[1]
  nj = dim(data)[2]
  
  # Set up the size of the arrays containing the survival probabilities, recapture 
  # probabilities and cell probabilities and set them all initially to zero 
  
  phi <- array(0,(nj-1))
  p <- array(0,(nj-1))
  pbar <- array(0,(nj-1))
  q <- array(0,dim=c(ni,nj))
  
  # Define the parameters to be constant or time-dependent
  
  for (t in 1:nj) {
    p[t] <- 1/(1+exp(-theta[1]))
    phi[t] <- 1/(1+exp(-theta[2]))
    pbar[t] <- 1-p[t]
  }
  
  # Calculate the multinomial cell probabilities
  
  # Diagonal elements
  
  for (t in 1:ni){
    q[t,t] <- phi[t]*p[t]
  }
  
  # Off diagonal elements
  
  for (t in 1:(ni-1)){
    for (j in (t+1):(nj-1)) {
      q[t,j] <- prod(phi[t:j])*prod(pbar[t:(j-1)])*p[j]
    }
  }
  
  # Calculate the disappearing animal probabilities
  
  for (t in 1:ni){
    q[t,nj] <- 1 - sum(q[t,t:(nj-1)])
  }
  
  # Calculate the likelihood function
  
  likhood <- 0
  
  for (t in 1:ni){
    for (j in t:nj) {
      likhood <- likhood + data[t,j]*log(q[t,j])
    }
  }
  
  # Output the negative loglikelihood value:
  likhood<- -likhood
}

# MLE
opt.constant <- optim(par = c(1, 1),
                      fn = caplik.constant,
                      data = marr.full, 
                      hessian = TRUE)
```

```{r MLE-constant, echo = FALSE}
MLE.constant <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/MLE.constant.rds")
knitr::kable(MLE.constant)
```

## 2. Sex dependent survival probabilities

Since the recapture probability is high ($p =$
`r round(plogis(opt.constant$par)[1], 3)`), we do not expect any
difference if we model them age or sex dependent. Hence, we would keep
$p$ constant in this analysis. Now we are curious about whether the
survival probabilities vary with sex. Let $\phi_m$ and $\phi_f$ to
represent the survival probabilities of male and female. We split the
database into 2 separated database according to their sex, and denote
them `CH.m` and `CH.f` respectively.

```{r marr-sex, echo = FALSE}
CH.m <- as.matrix(CR.sex.chicks09[which(CR.sex.chicks09$Sex == "M"), 1:13])
CH.f <- as.matrix(CR.sex.chicks09[which(CR.sex.chicks09$Sex == "F"), 1:13])
marr.m <- marray(CH.m)
marr.f <- marray(CH.f)
```

The likelihood function is slightly different from the constant model,
since we have to form two $\underline{q}$ matrix for both male and
female. The log likelihood function becomes

$$
l(\underline{x};\theta) = l(\underline{x_m};\theta_m) + l(\underline{x_f};\theta_f)
$$

where

$$
l(\underline{x_m}, \theta_m) = \sum_{i = 1}^{T-1} \sum_{j = 2}^{T}\text{m-array}_m[i, j]\times \log{\underline{q_m}[i, j]} \quad \text{and}\\
l(\underline{x_f}, \theta_f) = \sum_{i = 1}^{T-1} \sum_{j = 2}^{T}\text{m-array}_f[i, j]\times \log{\underline{q_f}[i, j]}, 
$$

so we also need to construct $\underline{q}$ for the different sex
class. Define function `caplik.sex` to compute the negative log
likelihood for this model.

The estimates for $p$ and $\phi$ depends on sex are shown below.

```{r params-sex, echo = FALSE}
MLE.sex <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/MLE.sex.rds")
knitr::kable(MLE.sex)
```

The difference between $\phi_m$ and $\phi_f$ is about 0.02. From the
result above, it seems like the sex of an individual does not affect the
apparent survival probability.

## 3. Model with Age-dependent survival probabilities

Next, we want to see if the age of an individual affect the survival
probabilities. Usually, young individuals have lower survival
probabilities than adults. We denote $\phi_a$ as the apparent survival
probability for individuals at age $a$. We are going to consider
different number of age classes:

-   $a = 1, 2, 3+ //\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_{3+}$
-   $a = 1, 2, 3, 4+ //\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, \phi_{4+}$
-   $a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ //\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, \phi_4, \phi_{5+}$

then we decide which model is the best.

In CJS model, in m-array formulation, we will need to construct one
m-array for each age class. For instance, for 3 age classes, we will
have to construct 3 m-arrays and 3 $\underline{q}$ matrices accordingly.

Since the age of individuals changes through years, cell probabilities
in $\underline{q}$ are different from the sex case. The probability of
capture history also changes as we have a different $\phi_a$ for
different age $a$.

Using the same example as before, for a capture history

$$
x_i = 1 \quad 1 \quad 0 \quad 1 \quad 1
$$

the probability of this capture history is now

$$
\mathbb{P}(x_i) = \phi_1p\phi_2(1-p)\phi_3p\phi_3p
$$

While we have only 3 age classes, $\phi_a$ beyond the third occasion
after the first capture are all $\phi_3$ instead of $\phi_4, \phi_5$
etc.

Now, for example, when $T = 5$ and if we choose to have 3 age classes,
the $\underline{q}$ for age 1 individuals is like

![q matrix for age 1 individuals (total 3 age
classes)](images/q-marray-age.png)

Similar structure will have ages 2, 3, 4 and 5+. For the likelihood
function, the construction is the same as before with log likelihood

$$
l(\underline{x};\theta) = \sum_{a}^{A} l(\underline{x_{a}};\theta_{a}) 
$$ with $A = 3, 4, 5$ representing the number of age class. For example,
$a = 1, 2, 3, 4$ for $A = 4$.

For our data, we do not have any individuals re-captured on the occasion
after the first capture, i.e. we have not seen any 1 year old individual
(which is often the case), so we can not estimate $\phi_1$ and $p$
separately, only its product $\phi_1 p$. Therefore we let $\phi_1 = 1$
and $p_1 = 0$ (here $p_1$ means $p$ for occasion 2), the rest of the
calculation remains the same. Therefore, $\phi_2$ can be interpreted as
the survival probability until 2 year old. Define functions
`caplik.age3`, `caplik.age4` and `caplik.age5` for the three models.

The estimate for each model is shown below.

```{r MLE-age, echo = FALSE}
MLE.age <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/MLE.age.rds")
knitr::kable(MLE.age)
```

From the results we can see that individuals with more than 2 years old
have a higher apparent survival probability for all models as we
expected.

We have done three age-dependent models, now we are going to decide
which one is the best model. In this analysis, we are going to use the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) approach for model-selection. The AIC
of a model is defined as

$$
AIC = -2\log{L(\underline{x}, \hat{\theta})} + 2d
$$ where $d$ is the number of parameters estimated. The model with the
smallest AIC value is preferred.

Compute the AIC for each model, the result is shown below

```{r AIC-age, echo = FALSE}
AIC.age <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/AIC.age.rds")
knitr::kable(AIC.age)
```

The model with 3 age classes has the lowest AIC =
`r round(AIC.age[1, 1], 3)` and therefore it is the best among the three
age-dependent models.

## 4. Models with survival probabilities age and sex dependent

We have already implicated models where survival probabilities were
sex-dependent as well as age-dependent. Now we are going to combine them
together, which means that survival probabilities we will depend on age
and sex, $\phi_{a,s}$. For example, $\phi_{1,m}$ represent survival
probability for individuals who are male and at age 1. For 3 age
classes, we have in total 7 parameters, a constant $p$, and 6 $\phi$ for
both males and females at different age. We will also do 3 models with
different numbers of age classes as before.

The log likelihood function now becomes

$$
l(\underline{x};\theta) = \sum_{a}^{A} l(\underline{x_{a,m}};\theta_{a,m}) + \sum_{a}^{A} l(\underline{x_{a,f}};\theta_{a,f})\\
$$

We use the same approach as before, define three functions
`caplik.age3.sex`, `caplik.age4.sex` and `caplik.age5.sex` accordingly,
the result for each model shows below.

```{r MLE-table, echo = FALSE}
MLE.age.sex <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/MLE.age.sex.rds")
knitr::kable(MLE.age.sex)
```

Compute the AIC for each model.

```{r AIC-age-sex, echo = FALSE}
AIC.age.sex <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/AIC.age.sex.rds")
colnames(AIC.age.sex) <- "AIC"
knitr::kable(AIC.age.sex)
```

From the results above, the model with the lowest AIC =
`r AIC.age.sex[3, 1]` is the one with 5 age classes. As we can see,
there is almost no sex effect on the estimate of survival probabilities
in this model. Hence we would like to set some of the $\phi.m$ and
$\phi.f$ to be the same for some certain age class to see if the model
improves.

## Model selection

Now we choose 5 models, and assess their performance:

-   Model 1: all survival probabilities differ for males and females
-   Model 2: $\phi_{2.m} = \phi_{2.f}$
-   Model 3: $\phi_{2, 3.m} = \phi_{2, 3.f}$
-   Model 4: $\phi_{2, 3, 4.m} = \phi_{2, 3, 4.f}$
-   Model 5: constant survival probabilities for both males and females

Following the same methedology previously explained, we form the
likelihood function for each model and then use `optim` to find the MLE.
We then compute the AIC of each model with the following results,

```{r model-AIC, echo = FALSE}
model.selection <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/model.selection.rds")
knitr::kable(data.frame(model.selection))
```

Model 4 gives the lowest AIC = `r model.selection[4, 2]`. So we set
$\phi_{2, 3, 4.m} = \phi_{2, 3, 4.f}$, and a different survival
probabilities for 5 years old males and females, the estimate of the
parameters are shown below.

```{r params, echo = FALSE}
params <- readRDS(file = "data/derived/params.rds")
knitr::kable(data.frame(params))
```

## Discussion

In conclusion, we have implement CJS models to estimate the apparent
survival probability and recapture probability. We have built several
different models which regard to age and/or sex of the individuals, and
we have used AIC method for model selection. The best model (in terms of
AIC) was that with constant recapture probability, common sex-survival
probabilities for ages 2 to 4, and different sex-survival probabilities
for age 5+.

Guillemot are long live sea birds that in some cases they can live about
40 years. Although both sexes take care of the chick, the energy spent
in breeding differs between sexes. This fact may affect the survival
probabilities, mainly at older ages. The results are in line with this,
showing a common survival probabilities for both sexes until 4 years old
(juvenile birds) and being slightly different for breeders (5+).

However, we can see that the difference in the survival probability for
males and females are very small. Also, we have higher $\phi_3$ and
$\phi_4$ than $\phi_5$. This may not be the case for the whole
population. Further analyses are needed to see if there are other
factors affecting there results.

In this project we only discuss the effects of sex and age on survival
probabilities, but there are many other associated factors that can
affect the survival probabilities, which are also worth investigating.
In addition, due to the long life expectancy, more age classes can be
added to see how survival probabilities differ by age.

Finally, it is worth to note that the estimated parameters are higher
than the expected. This may be because of how the data is collected. For
our special case, this lab has a globally unique research platform with
an artificial rock shelf with enough space to host hundreds of breeding
birds. The base of this platform rests in the middle of an established
Common Guillemot colony, so instead of staring with binoculars or
telescope in thousand meters away, scientists can study the birds from a
distance of bare centimeters. This makes sure the data has high
precision (recapture probability is almost 1).

This report only shows the result of this database, which does not
represent the estimation for the entire population.
