# Introduction

The role of statistical graphics is essential for exploratory data analysis, checking models, and making diagnoses. Knowing whether data follows a certain distribution is important for doing analysis. For example, when we are fitting a linear regression model between two variables, we need to check the assumption of residual that it is normally distributed. We can interpret the distribution of data using numerical tests or visually with the use of a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. Numerical tests can be useful for quickly assessing normality, while they do not provide as much insight into the underlying distribution as a Q-Q plot. Graphical technique such as a Q-Q plot is the most popular approach for distributional assessment, while their interpretation is criticized for being subjective. This study examines how individuals, including students and experts in statistics, interpret data visualizations, particularly Q-Q plots, and how subjectivity can affect decision-making through a survey.
