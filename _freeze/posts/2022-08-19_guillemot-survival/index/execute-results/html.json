Data were\nrecorded from 2009 to 2021.\n\nPhoto by Aron Heidström, <a href=\"http://www.balticseabird.com/auklab/\">\nBaltic Seabird Project</a>\n\n![](images/lab.jpg)\n\nSeabirds inhabit marine ecosystems and they share several life history\ntraits: high adult survival, a progressive access to reproduction at\nrelatively old ages, a low reproductive rate and a low number of natural\npredators. Adult survival as well as juvenile survival, are considered\nimportant traits that influence population dynamics in seabird species.\nHowever, survival estimation can be challenging.\n\nIdeally, individuals would be followed from birth to death with a given\nstudy period, but this is rarely possible for wild populations. The\nproblem arises since the observation process relating to individuals is\nimperfect, and hence we cannot always make a direct measurement of the\nstate variable of interest (i.e. alive or dead). In the wild, if an\nindividual is not observed two options are possible: (i) it is dead, or\n(ii) it is still alive (but it has not been observed). This problem can\nbe addressed using the capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method.\n\nCMR methods use data collection protocols where observers go into the\nfield at a series of capture events, denoted t = 1, . . . , T. At each\ncapture event, the observer marks the new individuals, records all\nobserved individuals (already marked) and releases them back into the\npopulation. This leads to data corresponding to the capture history of\neach individual, detailing at which capture occasions they are observed\nor not.\n\nA capture history or capture-recapture takes the form of a vector of\nlength the number of encounter occasions $T$, and records the value 1\nfor a live encounter and 0 when an individual was not encountered. This\ndata set also contains the sex of each individual as an additional\ninformation. The main interest in this project is to estimate the main\nparameters, which are the recapture and the apparent survival\nprobabilities. The survival probabilities, denoted by $\\phi_t$,\nrepresent the probability of that an individual is alive at time $t$ and\nsurvives until time $t+1$ (for time $t = 1, ..., T-1$, for all\nindividuals). Similarly, the recapture probabilities, denoted by $p_t$\nrepresent the probability of observing an individual at time $t$ (from\n$t = 2, ..., T$ and for all individuals).\n\nWe use $p_t$ to denote the recapture probability at occasion $t$, ang\n$\\phi_t$ to denote the apparent survival probability between occasion\n$t$ and $t+1$.\n\nThe primary interest in these studies is usually the estimation of\nsurvival probabilities and the associated factors (or covariates) that\nmay influence these. Such covariates may include for example, age,\nenvironmental covariates, sex, individual heterogeneity, etc. In this\nproject we will focus on the estimation of age and/or sex-dependent\nsurvival probabilities for this colony of common guillemots. This will\ninvolve developing statistical models to incorporate and assess the\nimpact of age and sex on the survival estimates within a formal\nmodelling framework in order to improve our understanding of the\npopulation which in turn may aid in their management and conservation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nIn the next table, and for simplicity, we present a subset of the data,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| 2009| 2010| 2011| 2012| 2013| 2014| 2015| 2016| 2017| 2018| 2019| 2020| 2021|Sex |\n|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|:---|\n|    1|    0|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|M   |\n|    1|    0|    0|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|F   |\n|    1|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    1|    0|    0|    0|    0|F   |\n|    1|    0|    0|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|F   |\n|    1|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|F   |\n|    1|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|    1|F   |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach row contains a capture history across 13 occasions for each\nindividuals with the last column indicate their sex. The database\ncontains information about 117 individuals, all of them ringed as chicks\ni.e. at age 1, therefore $T = 13$.\n\nIn this study we will use the standard Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model\nwhich is considered a general framework for several number of extensions\nand which is conditional at initial capture (ringing time). More\ninformation about these and related models see: Serber and Schofield,\n2019; McCrea and Morgan, 2015; king et al. 2010 (among many others).\n\nWe are going to implement CJS models in the frequentist approach,\nbuilding likelihood function for each model, then use `optim` function\nto find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for $\\boldsymbol{p}$ and\n$\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ parameters.\n\n## 1. Constant Model\n\nWe start with the most basic model: model with constant $\\boldsymbol{p}$\nand $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ parameters. In other words, recapture and\nsurvival probabilities are invariant with age, time and sex.\n\nFirstly, we need to transform the capture history into m-array format.\nM-array is a $(T-1) \\times T$ matrix with each row representing a\nreleased occasion ($i = 1, ..., T-1$), and each column representing a\nrecapture occasion ($j = 2, ..., T$). The last column contains the\nnumber of individuals that have never been recaptured in each released\noccasion. For example, the $[1, 2]$ cell contains the number of\nindividuals which released in occasion 1 and next recaptured in occasion\n2.\n\nWe have defined a function `marray` in `functions.R` file to help us to\ntransform the data. Let `marr.full` be the m-array of the full data set,\nwhich is shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|       | j = 2| j = 3| j = 4| j = 5| j = 6| j = 7| j = 8| j = 9| j = 10| j = 11| j = 12| j = 13| never recaptured|\n|:------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|------:|------:|------:|------:|----------------:|\n|i = 1  |     0|     1|     2|     1|     0|     1|     0|     1|      0|      0|      0|      0|                1|\n|i = 2  |     0|     0|     0|     2|     1|     1|     0|     1|      0|      0|      0|      0|                1|\n|i = 3  |     0|     0|     1|     0|     5|     4|     0|     0|      0|      0|      0|      0|                0|\n|i = 4  |     0|     0|     0|     3|     0|     2|     1|     0|      0|      0|      0|      0|                3|\n|i = 5  |     0|     0|     0|     0|     6|     2|    11|     4|      0|      0|      0|      0|                3|\n|i = 6  |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|    12|     0|     1|      0|      0|      0|      0|                0|\n|i = 7  |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|    21|     1|      0|      0|      0|      0|                0|\n|i = 8  |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|    33|      0|      0|      0|      0|                1|\n|i = 9  |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     37|      2|      6|      1|               12|\n|i = 10 |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|      0|     35|      4|     10|               17|\n|i = 11 |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|      0|      0|     31|      1|               26|\n|i = 12 |     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|     0|      0|      0|      0|     35|                6|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext we are going to form a likelihood function for the constant model.\n\nLet $\\underline{x}$ be the capture history of the whole data where $x_i$\nis the capture history of individual $i = 1, ..., 117$, and\n$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ be the parameters used to estimate $p$ and $\\phi$.\nSince we are going to use `optim` to maximise the negative log\nlikelihood function to give the MLE of the desired parameters, we need\nto remove the boundary of the parameters. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ be\nan array contains the logit transformation of the parameters $\\phi$ and\n$p$, then the boundary of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is now all real numbers\ninstead of $(0, 1)$.\n\nEach row of the m-array follows a multinomial distribution with\nparameters $N_i$ and $\\underline{q}$, then the likelihood function of\nthe whole data is the product of multinomial distribution, i.e.\n\n$$\nL(\\underline{x};\\theta) = \\prod_{i}^{T-1}Multinomial(N_i, \\underline{q})\n$$ where $N_i$ represents the total number of released animals at time\n$i$ and $\\underline{q} = f(\\phi, p)$ is a matrix which represents the\ncell probabilities depending on $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ and\n$\\boldsymbol{p}$.\n\nNow we are going to explain how to construct $\\underline{q}$.\n\nFirstly we need to explain how to compute the probability of a capture\nhistory. For example, if we have a capture history\n\n$$\nx_i = 1 \\quad 1 \\quad 0 \\quad 1 \\quad 1\n$$\n\nthe probability of this capture history is\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(x_i) = \\phi p \\phi (1-p) \\phi p \\phi p\n$$\n\nSo each cell in matrix $\\underline{q}$ represent the probability of an\nindividual being in the corresponding cell in the m-array. As the row\nsum of the probabilities is 1, the last column which represent the\nprobability of never recaptured is 1 - row sum. For example, when\n$T = 5$, matrix $\\underline{q}$ has the form shown below.\n\n![q matrix](images/q-marray.png)\n\nWe need the log likelihood function for simple calculation. The log\nlikelihood function is constructed by\n\n$$\nl(\\underline{x}, \\theta) = \\sum_{i}^{T-1} \\log{Multinomial(N_i, \\underline{q})} = \\sum_{ i= 1}^{T-1} \\sum_{j = 2}^{T}\\text{m-array}[i, j] \\times \\log{\\underline{q}[i, j]}.\n$$\n\nWe create a function `caplik.constant` for the negative log likelihood\nfunction, then use `optim` to find the MLE of our parameters of\ninterest, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. Transfer the estimate of\n$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ back to $p$ and $\\phi$ using `plogis`. Also, we\ncan obtain standard error for each parameter from inverting the Hessian\nmatrix at the MLE.\n\nWe can compute the credible interval for each parameter using bootstrap\nmethod. Take 50 resamples, find lower and upper quantile for the\nestimated parameters. The MLE, SD, and 95% credible interval (CI) for\nestimated parameters are shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|       |MLE   |SD    |CI            |\n|:------|:-----|:-----|:-------------|\n|$p$    |0.539 |0.098 |[0.473,0.592] |\n|$\\phi$ |0.932 |0.093 |[0.903,0.958] |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2. Sex dependent survival probabilities\n\nSince the recapture probability is high ($p =$\n0.539), we do not expect any\ndifference if we model them age or sex dependent. Hence, we would keep\n$p$ constant in this analysis. Now we are curious about whether the\nsurvival probabilities vary with sex. Let $\\phi_m$ and $\\phi_f$ to\nrepresent the survival probabilities of male and female. We split the\ndatabase into 2 separated database according to their sex, and denote\nthem `CH.m` and `CH.f` respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe likelihood function is slightly different from the constant model,\nsince we have to form two $\\underline{q}$ matrix for both male and\nfemale. The log likelihood function becomes\n\n$$\nl(\\underline{x};\\theta) = l(\\underline{x_m};\\theta_m) + l(\\underline{x_f};\\theta_f)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nl(\\underline{x_m}, \\theta_m) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{T-1} \\sum_{j = 2}^{T}\\text{m-array}_m[i, j]\\times \\log{\\underline{q_m}[i, j]} \\quad \\text{and}\\\\\nl(\\underline{x_f}, \\theta_f) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{T-1} \\sum_{j = 2}^{T}\\text{m-array}_f[i, j]\\times \\log{\\underline{q_f}[i, j]}, \n$$\n\nso we also need to construct $\\underline{q}$ for the different sex\nclass. Define function `caplik.sex` to compute the negative log\nlikelihood for this model.\n\nThe estimates for $p$ and $\\phi$ depends on sex are shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|         |MLE   |SD    |CI            |\n|:--------|:-----|:-----|:-------------|\n|$p$      |0.539 |0.098 |[0.476,0.583] |\n|$\\phi_m$ |0.92  |0.135 |[0.86,0.95]   |\n|$\\phi_f$ |0.944 |0.127 |[0.885,0.977] |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe difference between $\\phi_m$ and $\\phi_f$ is about 0.02. From the\nresult above, it seems like the sex of an individual does not affect the\napparent survival probability.\n\n## 3. Model with Age-dependent survival probabilities\n\nNext, we want to see if the age of an individual affect the survival\nprobabilities. Usually, young individuals have lower survival\nprobabilities than adults. We denote $\\phi_a$ as the apparent survival\nprobability for individuals at age $a$. We are going to consider\ndifferent number of age classes:\n\n-   $a = 1, 2, 3+ //\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_{3+}$\n-   $a = 1, 2, 3, 4+ //\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\phi_{4+}$\n-   $a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ //\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\phi_4, \\phi_{5+}$\n\nthen we decide which model is the best.\n\nIn CJS model, in m-array formulation, we will need to construct one\nm-array for each age class. For instance, for 3 age classes, we will\nhave to construct 3 m-arrays and 3 $\\underline{q}$ matrices accordingly.\n\nSince the age of individuals changes through years, cell probabilities\nin $\\underline{q}$ are different from the sex case. The probability of\ncapture history also changes as we have a different $\\phi_a$ for\ndifferent age $a$.\n\nUsing the same example as before, for a capture history\n\n$$\nx_i = 1 \\quad 1 \\quad 0 \\quad 1 \\quad 1\n$$\n\nthe probability of this capture history is now\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(x_i) = \\phi_1p\\phi_2(1-p)\\phi_3p\\phi_3p\n$$\n\nWhile we have only 3 age classes, $\\phi_a$ beyond the third occasion\nafter the first capture are all $\\phi_3$ instead of $\\phi_4, \\phi_5$\netc.\n\nNow, for example, when $T = 5$ and if we choose to have 3 age classes,\nthe $\\underline{q}$ for age 1 individuals is like\n\n![q matrix for age 1 individuals (total 3 age\nclasses)](images/q-marray-age.png)\n\nSimilar structure will have ages 2, 3, 4 and 5+. For the likelihood\nfunction, the construction is the same as before with log likelihood\n\n$$\nl(\\underline{x};\\theta) = \\sum_{a}^{A} l(\\underline{x_{a}};\\theta_{a}) \n$$ with $A = 3, 4, 5$ representing the number of age class. For example,\n$a = 1, 2, 3, 4$ for $A = 4$.\n\nFor our data, we do not have any individuals re-captured on the occasion\nafter the first capture, i.e. we have not seen any 1 year old individual\n(which is often the case), so we can not estimate $\\phi_1$ and $p$\nseparately, only its product $\\phi_1 p$. Therefore we let $\\phi_1 = 1$\nand $p_1 = 0$ (here $p_1$ means $p$ for occasion 2), the rest of the\ncalculation remains the same. Therefore, $\\phi_2$ can be interpreted as\nthe survival probability until 2 year old. Define functions\n`caplik.age3`, `caplik.age4` and `caplik.age5` for the three models.\n\nThe estimate for each model is shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|         |3 age classes |      |              |4 age classes |      |              |5 age classes |      |              |\n|:--------|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|\n|         |MLE           |SD    |CI            |MLE           |SD    |CI            |MLE           |SD    |CI            |\n|$p$      |0.705         |0.107 |[0.651,0.768] |0.752         |0.107 |[0.686,0.801] |0.71          |0.107 |[0.643,0.803] |\n|$\\phi_2$ |0.636         |0.235 |[0.556,0.742] |0.592         |0.235 |[0.507,0.67]  |0.605         |0.235 |[0.484,0.677] |\n|$\\phi_3$ |0.981         |0.114 |[0.965,0.992] |1             |0.252 |[1,1]         |1             |0.252 |[0.998,1]     |\n|$\\phi_4$ |-             |-     |-             |0.967         |0.129 |[0.951,0.992] |0.979         |0.293 |[0.926,1]     |\n|$\\phi_5$ |-             |-     |-             |-             |-     |-             |1             |0.143 |[0.941,1]     |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the results we can see that individuals with more than 2 years old\nhave a higher apparent survival probability for all models as we\nexpected.\n\nWe have done three age-dependent models, now we are going to decide\nwhich one is the best model.

Models with survival probabilities age and sex dependent\n\nWe have already implicated models where survival probabilities were\nsex-dependent as well as age-dependent. Now we are going to combine them\ntogether, which means that survival probabilities we will depend on age\nand sex, $\\phi_{a,s}$. For example, $\\phi_{1,m}$ represent survival\nprobability for individuals who are male and at age 1. For 3 age\nclasses, we have in total 7 parameters, a constant $p$, and 6 $\\phi$ for\nboth males and females at different age. We will also do 3 models with\ndifferent numbers of age classes as before.\n\nThe log likelihood function now becomes\n\n$$\nl(\\underline{x};\\theta) = \\sum_{a}^{A} l(\\underline{x_{a,m}};\\theta_{a,m}) + \\sum_{a}^{A} l(\\underline{x_{a,f}};\\theta_{a,f})\\\\\n$$\n\nWe use the same approach as before, define three functions\n`caplik.age3.sex`, `caplik.age4.sex` and `caplik.age5.sex` accordingly,\nthe result for each model shows below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|         |3 age class |      |       |      |4 age class |      |       |      |5 age class |      |       |      |\n|:--------|:-----------|:-----|:------|:-----|:-----------|:-----|:------|:-----|:-----------|:-----|:------|:-----|\n|sex      |male        |      |female |      |male        |      |female |      |male        |      |female |      |\n|         |MLE         |SD    |MLE    |SD    |MLE         |SD    |MLE    |SD    |MLE         |SD    |MLE    |SD    |\n|$p$      |0.705       |0.107 |0.705  |0.107 |0.691       |0.107 |0.691  |0.107 |0.745       |0.107 |0.745  |0.107 |\n|$\\phi_2$ |0.621       |0.327 |0.653  |0.334 |0.632       |0.327 |0.664  |0.334 |0.593       |0.327 |0.625  |0.334 |\n|$\\phi_3$ |0.981       |0.171 |0.981  |0.153 |0.981       |0.348 |0.999  |0.364 |0.997       |0.348 |0.998  |0.364 |\n|$\\phi_4$ |-           |-     |-      |-     |1           |0.197 |0.99   |0.169 |0.999       |0.416 |0.967  |0.413 |\n|$\\phi_5$ |-           |-     |-      |-     |-           |-     |-      |-     |0.957       |0.224 |0.975  |0.186 |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCompute the AIC for each model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|              |     AIC|\n|:-------------|-------:|\n|3 age classes | 639.195|\n|4 age classes | 648.023|\n|5 age classes | 624.962|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the results above, the model with the lowest AIC =\n624.962 is the one with 5 age classes.

Hence we would like to set some of the $\\phi.m$ and\n$\\phi.f$ to be the same for some certain age class to see if the model\nimproves.\n\n## Model selection\n\nNow we choose 5 models, and assess their performance:\n\n-   Model 1: all survival probabilities differ for males and females\n-   Model 2: $\\phi_{2.m} = \\phi_{2.f}$\n-   Model 3: $\\phi_{2, 3.m} = \\phi_{2, 3.f}$\n-   Model 4: $\\phi_{2, 3, 4.m} = \\phi_{2, 3, 4.f}$\n-   Model 5: constant survival probabilities for both males and females\n\nFollowing the same methedology previously explained, we form the\nlikelihood function for each model and then use `optim` to find the MLE.\nWe then compute the AIC of each model with the following results,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Model                      |AIC     |\n|:--------------------------|:-------|\n|1. all phi depends on sex  |624.544 |\n|2. phi2.m = phi2.f         |719.15  |\n|3. phi2,3.m = phi2,3.f     |625.901 |\n|4. phi2,3,4.m = phi2,3,4.f |619.17  |\n|5. constant phi            |628.78  |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nModel 4 gives the lowest AIC = 619.17.

We have built several\ndifferent models which regard to age and/or sex of the individuals, and\nwe have used AIC method for model selection. The best model (in terms of\nAIC) was that with constant recapture probability, common sex-survival\nprobabilities for ages 2 to 4, and different sex-survival probabilities\nfor age 5+.\n\nGuillemot are long live sea birds that in some cases they can live about\n40 years. Although both sexes take care of the chick, the energy spent\nin breeding differs between sexes. This fact may affect the survival\nprobabilities, mainly at older ages. The results are in line with this,\nshowing a common survival probabilities for both sexes until 4 years old\n(juvenile birds) and being slightly different for breeders (5+).\n\nHowever, we can see that the difference in the survival probability for\nmales and females are very small. Also, we have higher $\\phi_3$ and\n$\\phi_4$ than $\\phi_5$. This may not be the case for the whole\npopulation. Further analyses are needed to see if there are other\nfactors affecting there results.\n\nIn this project we only discuss the effects of sex and age on survival\nprobabilities, but there are many other associated factors that can\naffect the survival probabilities, which are also worth investigating.\nIn addition, due to the long life expectancy, more age classes can be\nadded to see how survival probabilities differ by age.\n\nFinally, it is worth to note that the estimated parameters are higher\nthan the expected. This may be because of how the data is collected. For\nour special case, this lab has a globally unique research platform with\nan artificial rock shelf with enough space to host hundreds of breeding\nbirds. The base of this platform rests in the middle of an established\nCommon Guillemot colony, so instead of staring with binoculars or\ntelescope in thousand meters away, scientists can study the birds from a\ndistance of bare centimeters. This makes sure the data has high\nprecision (recapture probability is almost 1).\n\nThis report only shows the result of this database, which does not\nrepresent the estimation for the entire population.\n\n## Reference\n\nSeber, G.
